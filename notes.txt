Comparing NumPy vs Eigen (C++)
==============================
The current (comparable) code version in Numpy and Eigen (native) show that
the Eigen implementation is upto 3X faster. We are of course talking
sub-millisecond timescales for a 4x3 matrix. However, I'm guessing this
relative speed-up means larger gains for bigger matrices (e.g. 90x3), where
instead of 0.6 s we now have 0.2s  - which could mean a lot more 
computations over a unit time.
